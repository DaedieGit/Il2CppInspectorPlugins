**DO NOT request new plugins, features or title updates for existing plugins or support for using plugins. These issues will be closed without response. We do not provide support for plugins or take requests.**

Plugins are provided for example purposes only. If you need to use a loader plugin with an unsupported version of a title, please use the provided [plugin SDK](https://github.com/djkaty/Il2CppInspector/wiki/Plugins%3A-Getting-Started) to update the relevant plugin yourself and submit a PR.

We will not automatically update loader plugins for title version updates.
